# Tend: Concept Brief

**Version:** 3.1
**Last Updated:** January 2026
**Status:** MVP Definition

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Tend is a mobile app that makes dietary adherence feel visceral instead of tedious. Rather than managing spreadsheets, charts, or food diaries, users care for a living entity—a **Radiant Core**—whose luminosity, warmth, and breathing rhythm reflect their eating habits. Good choices make it glow and breathe deeply; poor choices cause it to dim and struggle.

The app serves as a *"trojan horse"* for healthy eating: the underlying mechanics are grounded in evidence-based approaches (calorie tracking, dietary adherence), but the interface replaces numbers with physics-based emotional feedback.

The Radiant Core represents the user's inner metabolic fire—an externalization of their vitality, energy, and life force. When users look at their Core, they see a mirror of their own wellbeing.

> **One-line pitch:** Tend to your fire—watch it glow when you eat well, dim when you don't.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Market Gap

Millions of people want to lose weight or eat healthier. Many know that tracking what they eat is effective. Yet most tracking apps fail them because:

- **Calorie counting feels like homework.** Apps like MyFitnessPal require logging every ingredient, scanning barcodes, and managing numbers. This appeals to committed "quantified self" users but alienates everyone else.

- **The feedback is abstract.** Seeing "-200 calories" or a green progress bar doesn't *feel* like anything. There's no emotional resonance, no delight, no reason to keep opening the app.

- **The failure mode is shame.** When users slip up, they see red numbers and broken streaks. Many abandon the app entirely rather than face the judgment.

### The Opportunity

There is a large, underserved audience: people who *want* to improve their eating habits, *would* use an app to help, but are turned off by the clinical, spreadsheet-like experience of existing tools. These users:

- Value simplicity and delightful UX over comprehensive data
- Are drawn to novel, viral apps (think: Pokémon Go, Duolingo, gamified habit trackers)
- Want to spend more time living their lives, less time logging
- May have tried and abandoned traditional tracking apps

Tend is designed for this audience—including those who wouldn't normally consider a "diet app" at all.

---

## 3. Core Philosophy

### The Shift

In traditional tracking apps, **data equals feedback.** You eat, you log, you see numbers.

In Tend, **physics equals feedback.** You eat, you log, you *feel* the consequences through a living, responsive entity.

### The Emotional Design

| Desired State | Should Feel Like | Expressed As |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Eating well | Vitality—warm, energized, clear | Core glows brightly, breathes deeply and slowly, floats gently |
| Eating poorly | Depletion—heavy, foggy, sluggish | Core dims, breathes shallow and fast, sinks and settles |

### The Reinforcement Loop

1. User makes an aligned food choice
2. Radiant Core brightens and breathes more deeply
3. User feels delight (not just intellectual satisfaction)
4. Delight motivates the next good choice
5. Cycle reinforces itself

This is the opposite of shame-based motivation. The dim Core is **waiting to be rekindled, not dying**—it's dormant vitality, not judgment.

---

## 4. The Radiant Core

The Radiant Core is a living ember—an abstracted, elemental form that represents the user's inner metabolic fire. It is smooth and organic in shape, resembling something you might find in nature—a river stone, a seed, a heart worn smooth by time. But it glows from within. Light escapes through delicate veins across its surface. And most importantly: **it breathes.**

### The Central Metaphor

Your body is a furnace. Food is fuel. The quality of that fuel—and how you burn it—determines everything: your energy, your clarity, your radiance, your longevity. The Radiant Core externalizes this invisible process.

| User's Body | The Core |
|-------------|----------|
| Metabolism | Inner fire |
| Cellular energy | Luminosity |
| Vitality/circulation | Warmth |
| Respiratory health | Breathing rhythm |
| Fatigue/depletion | Dimness, heaviness |
| Health/radiance | Brightness, buoyancy |

### The State Spectrum

The Core exists on a continuous spectrum between two poles: **Radiant** and **Dim**. This is not binary—the Core can be "mostly radiant with a hint of fatigue" or "dim but showing signs of rekindling."

#### Radiant State (Target / Aligned)

*Triggered by: High adherence percentage, caloric targets met*

- **Visual:** Bright white-gold inner core, warm golden glow, translucent surface with visible light-filled striations, large soft halo
- **Breathing:** Slow (4-6 breaths/min), deep, rhythmic—like restful, satisfied breathing
- **Particles:** Golden sparks rise gently upward, embers drift and fade, subtle heat shimmer
- **Physics:** Buoyant (floats upward), lively bounce, moves freely, responds quickly to touch

#### Dim State (Deviation / Drifted)

*Triggered by: Low adherence percentage, caloric targets exceeded*

- **Visual:** Deep amber/burnt orange inner core, muddy glow, clouded surface with faint striations, minimal halo
- **Breathing:** Fast (12-18 breaths/min), shallow, irregular—like labored, strained breathing
- **Particles:** Thin smoke wisps, occasional falling ash, weak sparks that fall instead of rise
- **Physics:** Heavy (sinks and settles), minimal bounce, sluggish movement, slow response

### The Five-Tier Spectrum

While the Core transitions smoothly between states, these five tiers provide a useful framework for understanding its range:

| Adherence | State Name | Fire Metaphor | Core Impression |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 90-100% | **Blazing** | Roaring campfire | Brilliant glow, deep slow breathing, fully buoyant, sparks rising |
| 70-89% | **Warm** | Steady hearth fire | Strong glow, relaxed breathing, gently floating, steady particles |
| 50-69% | **Smoldering** | Banked coals | Moderate glow, neutral breathing, hovering at mid-level, mixed particles |
| 30-49% | **Dim** | Dying ember | Weak glow, shallow breathing, sinking lower, sparse particles |
| 0-29% | **Cold** | Ash with faint heat | Minimal glow, labored breathing, settled at bottom, smoke wisps only |

### The Breathing System

Breath is the most primal sign of life. By giving the Core a breathing rhythm that responds to dietary choices, we create a bridge between the abstract (nutrition data) and the visceral (a living thing in your hands, pulsing gently, waiting to be kindled).

The breath is autonomous—the Core breathes whether you're watching or not. Each breath cycle includes expansion, brightening, subtle lift on inhale; contraction, softening, gentle settle on exhale; and a moment of stillness before the next cycle. When dim, the breathing becomes irregular—occasionally catching, skipping, or growing shallow.

### What the Core Is Not

- **Not needy.** It doesn't demand attention. It simply reflects.
- **Not judgmental.** It doesn't scold. It just dims.
- **Not fragile.** You can't "kill" it. Even at minimum state, it breathes.
- **Not a pet.** You don't feed it directly. Your choices feed it.
- **Not sad.** When dim, it's tired and waiting—not heartbroken or guilt-inducing.

## 5. How It Works

### The Daily Loop

1. **User opens the app** to log a meal or snack
2. **User captures photo** (or enters text description)
3. **User taps "On track" or "Off track"** to indicate whether the meal aligned with their dietary goal
4. **Core responds immediately**, shifting along the spectrum based on updated daily adherence
5. **User can interact with the Core** (tap, swipe, hold) for fidget-style play—purely for delight

### What Drives the Core

**Primary Driver: Adherence Percentage**

Each logged meal is tagged as either "aligned" or "drifted." The Core reflects the user's adherence rate:

- 100% aligned today → Core near fully Radiant (Blazing)
- 50% aligned today → Core at neutral/middle (Smoldering)
- 0% aligned today → Core near fully Dim (Cold)

This calculation happens in real-time with each logged meal.

**Secondary Driver (Paid Feature): Caloric Modifier**

For users with AI calorie tracking enabled:

- At day's end (or upon next-day open), the Core receives a modifier based on caloric performance
- **Met or under caloric target:** Small boost toward Radiant (+10-15%)
- **Exceeded caloric target:** Small penalty toward Dim (-10-15%)

This keeps adherence as the primary experience while rewarding overall caloric discipline for those who want it.

### State Persistence

- **Timeframe:** Weekly, resetting each Monday
- **Logic:** The Core's baseline each day is influenced by cumulative weekly performance
- **Morning state:** Neutral at start of week; subsequent mornings carry forward weekly position

**Rationale:** Weekly cycles match how most people think about eating patterns ("good weekday discipline, weekend indulgence"). A week is short enough to feel recoverable after a bad day, but long enough to reveal meaningful patterns.

---

## 6. Interaction Model

### Logging Meals

- **Primary method:** Photo capture (simple, one-tap camera access)
- **Alternative:** Text input for quick entries ("coffee with cream," "leftover pasta")
- **After capture:** User sees the image and two buttons:
    - **"On track"** — This meal aligned with my goal
    - **"Off track"** — This meal drifted from my goal

The app does not judge or interpret what "on track" means—the user defines this based on their selected dietary goal.

### Fidget Interactions

The Core responds to touch for pure delight (no effect on state):

| Gesture | Core Response |
|---------|---------------|
| **Tap** | Receives impulse, emits sparks (Radiant) or weak glow (Dim); energy varies by state |
| **Swipe** | Flings in swipe direction with momentum; speed varies by state |
| **Hold** | Orbits finger gently; haptic warmth sensation |
| **Screen edges** | Bounces off boundaries (crisp ping when Radiant, dull thud when Dim) |

These interactions should feel "fidget-worthy"—something users do while waiting in line, watching TV, or just because it's satisfying.

### Haptic Feedback

Using CoreHaptics, synchronized to physics and breathing:

- **Breath sync:** Subtle pulse matching the breathing rhythm
- **Tap interaction (Radiant):** Light, crisp tick
- **Tap interaction (Dim):** Soft, muted thud
- **Wall collision (Radiant):** Sharp, crisp ping
- **Wall collision (Dim):** Heavy, dull thud
- **State improvement:** Warming crescendo (kindling)
- **State decline:** Cooling diminuendo (banking)

---

## 7. Emotional Design: The Failure Mode

**The Dim state should never feel like punishment.** The Core isn't angry, isn't judging, isn't dying. It is simply *waiting.* Like embers banked for the night, it can be rekindled tomorrow.

The Dim state should evoke:

- *"Oh, my little Core is tired"*
- *"I should take better care of it"*
- *"I'll do better tomorrow"*

**NOT:**

- *"I failed"*
- *"The app is judging me"*
- *"Why bother, it's ruined"*

This is achieved through:

- Slow, gentle transitions (not jarring)
- Continued signs of life (breathing never stops)
- Warm colors even when dim (amber, not grey)
- Sound that quiets rather than alarms
- Physics that slow rather than punish

---

## 8. Why Users Will Return

1. **The breathing is hypnotic.** Users will open the app just to watch their Core breathe. It's a fidget toy, a meditation object, a living screensaver.

2. **The warmth is comforting.** The combination of visuals, sound, and haptics creates a genuinely warm sensation. Users will hold their phone just to feel the Core pulse.

3. **The metaphor is motivating.** Unlike abstract numbers, the Core creates an emotional stake. *"My Core is dim"* feels different than *"I'm at 40% adherence."*

4. **Recovery is visible.** One good meal and you see the Core kindle. The feedback loop is immediate, tangible, rewarding.

5. **There's no shame cliff.** Traditional apps create a failure spiral (streak broken → shame → abandon). The Core is always recoverable. Even at minimum state, it breathes. Even tomorrow, it can be brighter.

---

## 9. Dietary Goals

Users select a dietary goal during onboarding. This contextualizes what "on track" means, though the user ultimately self-determines alignment.

### Preset Options (MVP)

- Keto / Low-carb
- Vegetarian
- Vegan
- Mediterranean
- Whole30 / Paleo
- Low sugar
- High protein
- Whole/minimally processed foods
- Custom (user defines their own goal in free text)

**Note:** The app does not validate or interpret these goals. Selecting "keto" simply labels the user's goal for their reference; the user still decides whether each meal is aligned.

## 10. Product Tiers

### Free Tier

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Meal logging | Photo or text, unlimited |
| Adherence tracking | Tag each meal as on/off track |
| Radiant Core | Full visual and animation spectrum |
| Fidget interactions | All touch gestures |
| Data view | Daily/weekly adherence percentage, meal history |
| Dietary goal | Preset or custom selection |

**Core value proposition:** *"Tend to your fire and watch it thrive."*

### Paid Tier (Premium)

Everything in Free, plus:

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| AI calorie estimation | Photo → automatic calorie estimate via AI |
| AI protein estimation | Photo → protein estimate |
| Caloric target | Calculated from user metrics or manually entered |
| Caloric modifier | Daily calorie performance affects Core state |
| Enhanced data view | Calories consumed vs. target, protein totals, trends |

**Core value proposition:** *"AI counts your calories so you don't have to."*

### Freemium Logic

The free tier is fully functional and valuable on its own. It builds the habit, the emotional attachment to the Core, and demonstrates the core value. Users who want more precision—particularly those interested in weight loss via CICO—upgrade for AI-powered insights without losing what they already love.

---

## 11. Information Architecture

The app should make all core functions easily accessible. Users should be able to quickly switch between:

1. **Core View** — Primary screen; full-screen Core interaction

2. **Log Meal** — Camera/text capture with on track / off track selection

3. **Adherence Data** — Daily/weekly percentage, meal history, goal display

4. **Detailed Data (Premium)** — Calorie/protein tracking, trends, caloric target progress

**Design principle:** The data view is a first-class citizen, not buried in settings. Users who want data should access it in one tap—but the Core remains the emotional center of the app.

---

---

## 13. Technical Approach

### Platform

- **iOS (Mobile)** — Primary target
- **Future:** Android, potentially tablet-optimized

### Language & Frameworks

- **Swift** — Primary language
- **SwiftUI** — Container UI, navigation, data views, onboarding
- **SpriteKit** — Core rendering, particle systems, physics
- **CoreHaptics** — Synchronized tactile feedback

### Rendering Approach

The Radiant Core uses a layered, procedural rendering approach:

- **Core shape:** Textured sprite with normal map for depth illusion; semi-translucent with subsurface scattering effect
- **Inner core:** Additive-blended glow sprite, positioned off-center, pulsing with breath
- **Striations:** Animated texture overlay; brightness interpolates with state
- **Glow/halo:** Gaussian blur on bright elements using `SKEffectNode`
- **Particles:** SKEmitterNode for sparks, embers, smoke; parameters (color, velocity, lifetime, direction) interpolate with state
- **Heat distortion:** Subtle refraction effect above Core when Radiant

### Breathing Implementation

The breath is procedurally animated, not pre-rendered:

```
breathPhase = (currentTime % cycleDuration) / cycleDuration
breathValue = sin(breathPhase * 2π)
scale = baseScale + (breathValue * breathDepth)
brightness = baseBrightness + (breathValue * brightnessRange)
```

Irregularity is added for Dim states using noise functions.

### Physics Behavior

SpriteKit physics world handles Core movement:

- **Gravity:** Scales with state (low when Radiant = buoyant; high when Dim = heavy)
- **Restitution:** High when Radiant (bouncy); low when Dim (thuds)
- **Damping:** Low when Radiant (moves freely); high when Dim (sluggish)
- **Screen boundaries:** Physics bodies at edges; collision behavior varies by state

### State Interpolation

All visual and physics properties interpolate based on adherence percentage:

```
currentGravity = lerp(radiantGravity, dimGravity, 1 - adherencePercent)
currentHue = lerpColor(radiantHue, dimHue, 1 - adherencePercent)
breathRate = lerp(radiantBreathRate, dimBreathRate, 1 - adherencePercent)
```

### AI Integration (Paid Tier)

- API-based image analysis for calorie/protein estimation
- Specific provider TBD (brief is agnostic)
- Users must accept that AI estimates are approximations, not precise measurements

### Data & Accounts

- Account required (enables premium features, potential cloud sync)
- Local data persistence for core functionality
- Cloud sync approach TBD

---

## 15. Open Questions

The following require further research, testing, or deliberation:

1. **Behavioral validation:** The theory that physics-based feedback improves dietary adherence is intuited, not yet validated. User research and/or literature review recommended before scaling.

2. **Caloric modifier weighting:** The proposed +/- 10-15% modifier for caloric performance needs playtesting. Too weak and it feels pointless; too strong and it overshadows adherence.

3. **Weekly vs. longer persistence:** Weekly resets are the starting assumption, but some users may prefer monthly tracking. Consider making this configurable in future versions.

4. **"On track" subjectivity:** Users define their own alignment, which maximizes flexibility but could enable self-deception. Monitor whether this is a problem in practice.

5. **AI estimation acceptance:** The value proposition assumes users will accept approximate calorie counts. Test whether precision-oriented users churn or complain.

6. **Onboarding friction (paid):** Entering height/weight/age/activity is more friction than the free tier. Optimize this flow to minimize drop-off.

7. **Core attachment:** Monitor whether users form the anticipated emotional bond with their Core. If attachment is weak, investigate whether visual quality, breathing fidelity, or interaction depth is the limiting factor.
